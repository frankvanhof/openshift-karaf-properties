= Red Hat Fuse
:toc:

Red Hat Fuse is a lightweight, flexible integration platform that enables rapid integration
across the extended enterpriseâ€”on-premise or in the cloud.

Based on Apache Camel, Fuse leverages pattern-based integration, a rich connector catalog, and extensive
data transformation capabilities to enables users to integrate anything.

== Security Prerequisites

By default, no users are defined for the container. You can run the container in the
foreground in this case, but you will not be able to access the container remotely
and you will not be able to run it in the background.

To enable remote access to the container, you must create at least one user in
the `etc/users.properties` file. It is recommended that you create at least one user
with the `admin` role by adding the following configuration:

  admin = admin,_g_:admingroup
  _g_\:admingroup = group,admin,manager,viewer,systembundles,ssh

The `admin` role grants full administration privileges to the user.

== Quick Start

To start Fuse, run `bin/fuse` on Linux/Unix or `bin\fuse.bat` on Windows.

== Examples

Examples are available as separate download.
